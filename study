11 am -- pipeline starts 
2 pm complete 

critical bug --- riased yuesterday and that fix is not available in 11 am build
this fix is checked in at 11:30 after current build is started..

he has to wait till 2 pm to get current pipleline to be completed 


2 pm the new pipleline will start and it will have the fix which is provided at 11:30


so developer has to wait ideally from 11:30 to 2 pm


instead of that what we cud do abort the current pipelin and start a new pipleing on demand at 11:30 by developer
so he will get the early feed back
