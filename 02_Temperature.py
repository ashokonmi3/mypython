# ‚úÖ Questions to ask interviewer before writing code:
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Is the list guaranteed to have only integers (temperatures)?
# 2Ô∏è‚É£ What should I return if all temperatures are the same? (Return all 0s?)
# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Can the input list be empty?
# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Are negative temperatures possible, or only positive?
# How much time i have for this 

# Approach in simple language
# üëâ ‚ÄúI go through the list of temperatures one day at a time. 
# I will use use a stack to remember the days where I‚Äôm still waiting for a warmer temperature.
# Whenever I find a warmer temperature than a previous day stored on the stack, 
# I calculate how many days I had to wait by subtracting the indices. 
# I will fill this value into the result list.
# If I don‚Äôt find a warmer temperature for a day, 
# I leave its value as zero, since we initialized the answer list with zeros. 
# I feel This approach is efficient because each day‚Äôs index goes into the stack once 
# and comes out once.‚Äù

# Explanation of the daily_temperatures Code:
# "Let me walk you through my code for solving the daily temperatures problem."

# Initialization:

# First, I create a list called wait_time that has the same length as the input temperatures list, 
# and I initialize it with zeroes. This list will store, for each day, 
# how many days we need to wait until we see a warmer temperature. 
# If no warmer day comes, the value will remain zero.

# Use waiting_days to Track Days Waiting for Warmer Temperatures:

# Next, I use a list called waiting_days to keep track of the indices of days that are
#  waiting for a warmer temperature. This helps me remember the days for which I haven't 
# yet found a warmer temperature.

# As I loop through each temperature in the list, I compare the current day's temperature 
# with the temperature at the index stored at the top of the waiting_days list.

# Check for Warmer Day:

# If the current day's temperature is warmer than the temperature of the day at the
#  top of waiting_days, this means we have found a warmer day for the day stored at the 
# top of the waiting_days list.

# I then pop that day's index from waiting_days and calculate how many days we had to 
# wait by subtracting their positions (i.e., i - prev_day).

# I update the corresponding position in the wait_time list with this value,
#  representing the number of days it took to find a warmer day.

# Repeat the Process:

# I continue to check in a while loop as long as there are elements in waiting_days
#  and the current temperature is warmer than the one at the top of the waiting_days.

# Once the waiting_days stack is either empty or the current temperature is no longer warmer,
#  I stop the process for that particular day.

# Add the Current Day's Index to waiting_days:

# After checking for warmer days, I push the current day's index onto the waiting_days list, 
# so that this day can "wait" for a warmer temperature on subsequent iterations.

# Handle Days with No Warmer Temperature:

# At the end of the loop, any index still remaining in the waiting_days list did 
# not find a warmer day ahead, so the corresponding value in wait_time stays zero.

# Return the Result:

# Finally, I return the wait_time list, which contains how many days each day had to
#  wait for a warmer temperature. If a day did not find a warmer temperature, its value will remain 0.


   
# ‚úÖ Complexity explanation:
# Time complexity:
#   O(N) because we process each element at most twice:
#   once when we push its index onto the stack,
#   once when we pop it from the stack.
#
# Space complexity:
#   O(N) because in the worst case (e.g., decreasing temperatures)
#   we might have to store all indices in the stack at once.
#   Also, the answer list is of size N.
